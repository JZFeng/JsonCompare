# Background
When I was working in eBay ViewItem team, My first task in eBay is a task about comparing Experience Service response with the VLS response's listing module. I cannot find an existing tool that supports Json compare with ignoring JsonArray element sequence. Furthermore, I cannot ignore some JsonPaths during the compare.

So I decide to implement it myself.

[UPDATE] there is a 3rd party library called ![jsonuit](https://github.com/lukas-krecan/JsonUnit)
